# Pizza Cost-Benefit Analyzer

## Overview

This project is a Pizza Cost-Benefit Analyzer, developed in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It was created to help a market research company identify which pizza size offers the best cost-benefit ratio. The software takes various pizza sizes and their respective prices as input and generates a report displaying the absolute and relative (percentage) price differences between the pizzas. Additionally, it identifies which pizza size provides the best cost-benefit ratio.

## Features

1. **Input:** Accepts the name of the pizza size, its dimensions (e.g., diameter for round pizzas or height x width for rectangular and square pizzas), and the corresponding price. It continues to allow the user to input as many pizza sizes as desired, ensuring there are no duplicate sizes.

2. **Output:** Generates a report that lists all pizza names and sizes, ordered from the best to the worst cost-benefit ratio. The report also displays the percentage difference in price between each pizza size. The "Pizza Size (cm)" column indicates the diameter for round pizzas and the height x width for rectangular and square pizzas.


## Usage

To use this software, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the web application in your preferred web browser.

2. Input the pizza names, sizes, and prices according to the specified format.

3. Click the "Submit" button.
